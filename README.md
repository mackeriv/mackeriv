### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner developer focused on Java. While my background has primarily been in different industries, I have always had a passion for technology and software development! I've been learning from courses and completing various personal projects to grasp the basics and gain a good foundation in Java and object-oriented programming. I'll be sharing some of my projects here!
